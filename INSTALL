EnderUNIX CheckDNS INSTALL

You must use Makefile that prepared to your Operating System. The default makefile for BSD based Operating Systems.
For example to Linux users :

# cp Makefile.Linux Makefile


To install the compiled binary, type :

# ./install.sh

and binary file that named 'checkdns' will be installed to /usr/local/bin/ directory.

edit /usr/local/etc/checkdns.conf and set variables. Especially to use dns_srv_sfw = "none" your dns_conf_file should contain domain names line by line.

Example content of dns_conf_file :

domain.com
yourdomain.net
mydomain.org
ourdomain.net


copy checkdns.css to Html Output Directory that assigned by you in checkdns.conf file (is named html_output_dir).
