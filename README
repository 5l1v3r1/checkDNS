EnderUNIX CheckDNS
Internet Domain Name Server analysis and reporter

This program is a domain name server analysis and reporting tool.
It checks and reports whether a domain name, hosted by your organization,
is still in use, and if so, reports whether your name servers
are still the delegated name servers of the domain name in question.

Reports are generated both to the console and as HTML output. HTMLs also
include information about the MX and WWW records of the domain name.

The tool is expected to be of great use for Internet Service Providers who
are in need of keeping track of lame dns records.


You may uses this program and analysis domain names periodicaly with cron job,
 and save html output files into your web server's appropriate place.

An example cron job lines :

17 01 * * * /usr/local/bin/checkdns 1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null
